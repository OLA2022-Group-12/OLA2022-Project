    "# Determinism while using seeded randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "As a part of comparing the different learners and algorithms, we have to consider the randomness in the environment. While working with randomness, it's important to consider that unlikely things do still happen! Hence even though there might be determinism in the form of a random number generator always generating the same values across different iterations, that doesn't mean it is necessarily mean it's deterministic across it's parameters. Below follows two examples, where one is deterministic across its arguments while the latter doesn't seem to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB! It's important to notice how the random number generator is seeded/reset in the following examples, as we are running the exact same calls to randomness with the same random state, however the arguments to the randomness might be different."
